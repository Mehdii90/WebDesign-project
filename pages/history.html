                <p>The story of Versailles begins in <b> 1623 </b>when <b>Louis XIII</b>, King of France, ordered the
                    construction of a small
                    hunting lodge on the outskirts of Paris. Located in a rural forested area, it served as a peaceful
                    retreat away from the political intrigues of the capital. The modest building was made of brick and
                    stone, intended for practical use rather than luxury. However, <b>Louis XIII</b> gradually expanded
                    the
                    site, adding stables and gardens, indicating his growing fondness for the location. While the
                    original lodge no longer exists, this early development marked the beginning of Versailles'
                    transformation into one of the most iconic royal estates in the world.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The true metamorphosis of Versailles began under <b>Louis XIV</b>, who ascended the throne in 1643
                    and
                    resolved to make Versailles the seat of his court and government in <b>1661</b>. He envisioned a
                    palace
                    that would symbolize his absolute power as the "Sun King." Over the next several decades, the
                    hunting lodge grew into a vast architectural marvel. The expansion included the Hall of Mirrors, a
                    grand gallery with 357 mirrors reflecting the sunlight and symbolizing <b>Louis XIV</b>'s power.
                    Landscape
                    architect <b>André Le Nôtre</b> designed elaborate gardens with fountains, sculptures, and perfectly
                    manicured lawns, showcasing the wealth and influence of the French monarchy. By <b>1682</b>,
                    <b>Louis XIV</b>
                    moved his court to Versailles, making it the de facto capital of France. The palace became a hub of
                    art, culture, and political intrigue, cementing its legacy as a symbol of royal opulence.

                    <img src="assets/images/history/revolution2.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>By the late <b>18th century</b>, Versailles had become synonymous with the excesses of the monarchy, and its
                    grandeur stood in stark contrast to the struggles of the common people. In <b>May 1789</b>, King
                    <b>Louis XVI</b>
                    summoned the Estates-General to Versailles in an attempt to address France’s financial crisis. This
                    assembly, representing the three estates (clergy, nobility, and commoners), was held in the palace,
                    but it quickly escalated into a revolutionary movement. The Third Estate broke away, forming the
                    National Assembly and vowing to draft a new constitution in what became known as the Tennis Court
                    Oath. Versailles' role as a symbol of monarchy made it a focal point for revolutionary fervor, and
                    by <b>October 1789</b>, the royal family was forced to leave the palace for Paris under pressure
                    from an
                    angry mob.

                <h2>The Treaty of Versailles</h2>

                </div>
                <p>In <b>1919</b>, Versailles once again became a stage for international diplomacy with the signing of
                    the
                    Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended <b>World War I</b>. The treaty, signed in the Hall of
                    Mirrors,
                    imposed severe reparations on Germany and redrew the map of Europe, establishing new nations and
                    altering borders. The Hall of Mirrors, once a symbol of <b>Louis XIV</b>’s glory, now served as a
                    setting
                    for the contentious negotiations that followed the Great War. While the treaty aimed to ensure
                    lasting peace, its harsh terms created resentment in Germany, contributing to the rise of Adolf
                    Hitler and the outbreak of <b>World War II</b>. This moment marked Versailles not only as a
                    historical
                    monument but also as a stage for shaping modern global politics.</p>

                <p>Versailles has transformed from a royal palace into one of the most visited and iconic cultural
                    landmarks in the world. The Palace of Versailles, a<b> UNESCO</b> World Heritage Site since
                    <b>1979</b>, attracts
                    millions of tourists annually who come to admire its architectural grandeur, lavish interiors like
                    the Hall of Mirrors, and the expansive gardens designed by André Le Nôtre.

                    The estate includes the <b>Trianon Palaces</b> and <b>Marie-Antoinette</b>’s Estate, where visitors
                    can explore
                    the queen’s private retreat and the picturesque Hamlet. Versailles also serves as a venue for major
                    art exhibitions, cultural events, and state ceremonies, maintaining its role as a center of art and
                    diplomacy.

                    In addition to its historical and cultural significance, Versailles has a thriving modern town
                    around the palace, known for its charming streets, bustling markets, and a rich local life. As a
                    blend of history, culture, and community, Versailles today continues to embody the essence of French
                    heritage and remains a global symbol of grandeur and sophistication.</p>
