                        <h3>
                            The 109th Salon de l'École française presents some forty artists - painters, sculptors, draughtsmen and photographers - with the high artistic standards that have made its reputation and success.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            <br>The 109th Salon de l'Ecole française presents some forty contemporary artists, renowned or selected for the quality of their work.
                            <br>The guests of honor will be Versailles-born naval painter Bertrand de Miollis, and animal sculptor Alain Courtaigne.
                            <br>Since 1903, the Ecole française association has been promoting artists' works through its annual exhibition. An essential activity at a time when subsidies to the major Parisian Salons were dwindling and many galleries were closing.
                            <br>During the 20th century, it was one of the major Parisian Salons, and for some years now it has been held in the Royal City. A historic contemporary art fair, it combines tradition, modernity and a taste for the beautiful!
                            <br>To find out more, visit: salonecolefrancaise.com
                            <br>We look forward to seeing many of you before the festive season.
                            <br>A must-attend event following the great success of the previous Salon.

                        <h3>
                            The Atlas des 2-mers is a project based on the Fort Vert site in the Hauts-de-France region, in the Pas-de-Calais département.

                        <p>
                            <br>The exhibition “L'Atlas des 2-mers : déplacement” is a project designed by Frank Smith based on the Fort Vert site, located in the Hauts-de-France region, in the Pas-de-Calais département. 
                            <br>The Fort Vert coastal complex, with its 360 hectares of protected natural spaces, brings together a variety of environments characteristic of the North Sea coast: an immense foreshore, beaches, salt meadows, low dunes, hunting ponds, freshwater marshes, decalcified dunes, polders as well as stretches of trees and wetlands conducive to the presence of remarkable flora and fauna.
                            <br>The site also served as a base for a migrant camp. Dismantled in October 2016, it will have sheltered up to 9,000 exiles.

                            La ville intime is a poetic pictorial journey through the city, time and matter. It's an invitation to discover a new way of looking at the city, that of painter Lucie Gay.

                        <p>
                            <br>This exhibition presents paintings resulting from her experimental, innovative and free-flowing technical research. On view are small-format paintings of Versailles, created using ancient methods that she has reappropriated (tempera, earth and ochre pigments, natural binders and resins).
                            <br>With her personal vision of the city, nourished by her dreamlike observations, she rebuilds, reconstructs and finally restores what for her is the essence of these streets, alleys, passages and courtyards, where the passers-by who shape her intimate city live.

                            Artist Duy Anh Nhan Duc honors those who defy the limits of eternity before our very eyes: trees.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            <br>Monumental sculptures in wood, bark prints, canvases made from leaf, fruit and seed pigments, frescoes of forest soil... these are just some of the explorations into the heart of matter that Duy Anh Nhan Duc is experimenting with at Espace Richaud.
                            <br>The visual artist questions our links and interdependence with trees. Les cimes de l'asphalte evokes both the sacred place trees occupied in the cosmogony of primitive peoples, and those they occupy today in our modern societies.
                            <br>The exhibition pays homage to these giants of space and time, and shows the vital place they occupy, for if we are to make a successful ecological and climatic transition, it will only be with the help of trees and forests.

                            Martial Kermeur is arrested for throwing promoter Antoine Lazenec into the sea. Before the judge, he retraces the course of events that led to his arrest. Based on the Tanguy Viel novel.

                        <p>
                            <br>THE JUDGE: So you came back alone?
                            <br>
                            <br>KERMEUR: Yes, there were two of us and then I came back alone.
                            <br>
                            <br>THE JUDGE: So you know why you're here.
                            <br>
                            <br>KERMEUR: Yes, voluntary manslaughter.
                            <br>
                            <br>THE JUDGE: Yes. The body was found this morning.
                            <br>
                            <br>KERMEUR: I know.
                            <br>
                            <br>THE JUDGE: The best thing would be to start from the beginning.
                            <br>
                            <br>Martial Kermeur has just been arrested by the police for throwing property developer Antoine Lazenec into the sea. To the judge before whom he was brought, he retraced the course of events that led to his arrest: his divorce, the custody of his son Erwan, his dismissal and, above all, Lazenec's glittering plans. The temptation to invest all his redundancy money in a beautiful apartment overlooking the sea is great. But it has to be built.

                            Questioning ourselves in a benevolent way.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            <br>It's important to ask questions about inclusion in the associative sector, because an association is not necessarily inclusive by nature.
                            <br>Indeed, there is a strong temptation for associations to think that, because their governance is voluntary and democratic, they are inclusive by nature.
                            <br>To encourage associations to reflect on the issues surrounding inclusion, the MDAE invites you to take part in this morning's event.
